# Architecture Design Notes

## Overview
This directory contains system-level design notes and architectural diagrams
created to explore scalability, performance, and stream-based processing patterns.

The diagrams are not intended as final specifications,
but as tools to reason about trade-offs, constraints, and feasibility
before and during implementation.

## Focus Areas
- Scalability and throughput considerations
- Stream processing and event-driven architecture
- Design exploration under real-world constraints

## Intent
The primary purpose of these materials is to externalize architectural thinking,
validate assumptions, and support decision-making in complex systems.

All diagrams are managed in editable `.drawio` format
to preserve design intent and allow continuous iteration.

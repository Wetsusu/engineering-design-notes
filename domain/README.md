# Domain Design Notes

## Overview
This directory focuses on domain-level design and business logic structuring.

The diagrams aim to clarify complex rules and concepts,
especially where specifications tend to become ambiguous or tightly coupled to implementation.

## Focus Areas
- Business rules and domain concepts
- Complex calculation logic
- Edge cases derived from real operational constraints

## Intent
These materials are created to reduce cognitive load during implementation,
serve as a shared understanding of the domain,
and prevent logic from being implicitly embedded only in code.

The diagrams are intentionally kept close to the problem domain,
rather than optimized for any specific technical architecture.

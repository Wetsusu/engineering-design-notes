# Engineering Design Notes

## Overview
This repository contains design notes and diagrams created during real-world development projects,
with the purpose of structuring complex business logic and system architecture.

The materials are primarily created to clarify my own understanding,
validate design decisions, and support implementation in uncertain or high-complexity situations.

## Repository Structure
This repository is intentionally structured by design perspective:

- `domain/`  
  Diagrams that focus on business rules, domain concepts, and complex calculation logic
  (e.g. time-attendance and work-time calculation based on labor regulations).

- `architecture/`  
  Diagrams and notes related to system design, scalability, and stream-based architectures,
  derived from domain understanding and non-functional requirements.

## Contents
- Domain modeling and business logic structuring
- System and stream architecture design
- Scalability and throughput considerations
- Trade-off analysis and design exploration

## Notes
All materials are generalized and extracted to avoid including confidential or proprietary information.
The diagrams are managed in editable `.drawio` format to preserve design intent and allow iteration.
